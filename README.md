# monkey-go

Inspired by Thorsten Ball's interpreterbook.com "Writing an Interpreter in Go" where he writes a tree-walking Interpreter from scratch using Go, without any third-party libraries, for a modern programming language "monkey". My primary goal with this project is to dive deeper into interpreters, compilers, and language tooling with increasing my knowledge of Go as a secondary goal.
